# padmonk — Mouse and keyboard for Xbox Cloud Gaming

[![Install padmonk from the Chrome Web Store](assets/chrome-webstore.svg)](https://redirects.esskayesss.dev/padmonk-ext)

padmonk lets desktop Chromium players use mouse and keyboard on Xbox Cloud Gaming by presenting a virtual Xbox controller to the page. No driver install, no native helper app, no account, no telemetry. Open the extension, lock your mouse, tune aim, queue up.

This repo is for players, tinkerers, and contributors who want xCloud controls to feel less like menu wrestling and more like a proper loadout.

## What it does

- Maps WASD to left stick movement.
- Maps mouse movement to right stick aim through Pointer Lock.
- Maps keyboard, mouse buttons, and wheel input to Xbox controls.
- Runs entirely in browser page context through Gamepad API injection.
- Keeps settings local with live updates to open xCloud and tester tabs.
- Ships advanced remapping, sensitivity, smoothing, aim curve, invert-Y, profile import/export, and reset.

## Install from source

padmonk is now a bundled extension — it builds from TypeScript/Svelte sources into a `dist/` folder, and that built folder is what you load.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build the extension: `npm run build`
3. Open Chrome or Edge.
4. Go to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
5. Enable Developer mode.
6. Click Load unpacked.
7. Select the `dist/` folder (the build output — **not** the repo root).
8. Visit <https://www.xbox.com/play> or a gamepad tester.

For development with hot reload, run `npm run dev` and load the `dist/` folder it produces; edits to UI and content scripts rebuild live.

Desktop Chromium required. Safari/WebKit ignores this page-level virtual pad path. Android Chromium lacks needed Pointer Lock behavior for this use case.

## Test before dropping into xCloud

1. Open <https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad> or <https://gamepad-tester.com>.
2. Press mapped input such as `Space`.
3. Confirm `padmonk Virtual Xbox 360 Controller` appears.
4. Press WASD and confirm left stick moves.
5. Click page, move mouse, and confirm right stick moves.
6. Press `Esc` to release mouse.

If tester sees pad and inputs move, xCloud should see same controller layer.

## Use on Xbox Cloud Gaming

1. Go to <https://www.xbox.com/play>.
2. Start a game.
3. Click game video to lock mouse for aim.
4. Press your toggle combo (default `F8`) to toggle padmonk if you need real-controller control back.
5. Press your show-binds combo (default `F9`) while the game page has focus to show the visual controller binds overlay.
6. Tune settings from the extension popup.

The toggle and show-binds shortcuts are configurable combos (defaults `F8` / `F9`). Change them in Advanced remapping.

## Settings

Tune these from the extension popup (or Advanced remapping). The UI shows player-facing values; internally, padmonk converts them to the right-stick mapper constants.

| Setting | Default | Range | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Look speed** | `100%` | `10–280%` | How much mouse movement maps to right-stick deflection. Higher = the stick reaches full throw (max in-game turn rate) with less hand motion. This is the main "how fast do I aim" dial. |
| **Smoothing** | `25%` | `0–95%` | Response time-constant for aim. `0%` ≈ 25 ms (instant, snappiest, can feel twitchy on a cheap mouse); higher values lengthen it (`25%` ≈ 85 ms, up to ~250 ms) for buttery-smooth-but-laggier motion. It damps mouse polling jitter — it does **not** add a turn-speed cap. |
| **Deadzone lift** | `12%` | `0–50%` | Minimum non-zero stick output while the mouse is actively moving. Many games swallow tiny stick deflections inside a hidden deadzone, so slow mouse movement would do nothing. Raise it if slow aim feels dead; lower it if the crosshair creeps on its own. |
| **Fine aim boost** | `+25%` | `-100–+75%` | Shape around small mouse movement. `0%` is linear; positive values boost micro aim for easier tracking; negative values soften the start for slower, steadier aim. |
| **Invert Y** | `off` | on/off | Flips vertical aim (mouse up → look down). |
| **Lock pointer on click** | `on` | on/off | Auto-locks the mouse pointer when you click the game so aim works; `Esc` releases. Turn off if you prefer to lock manually. |

Aim is **framerate-independent** — it's driven by mouse velocity (px/s), so the same Sensitivity/Smoothing feel identical on a 60 Hz, 120 Hz, or 240 Hz display.

> Reminder: a virtual thumbstick has a maximum deflection, and at full throw the **game** sets the turn rate. Sensitivity/Smoothing change how fast you reach and leave that ceiling, but no setting (and no KBM-on-cloud tool) can exceed it — instant mouse-style 180° flicks aren't physically possible through the Gamepad API. If you get shot in the back and turn 180° at a leisurely controller pace, that is not a bug; that is the stick ceiling politely escorting you to the respawn screen.

**Shooter starter settings:**

- Look speed: `100–165%`
- Smoothing: `10–25%`
- Deadzone lift: `10–18%`
- Fine aim boost: `+15–+40%`

In-game, raise look sensitivity and disable aim deadzone when the game allows it. Hidden deadzones are the final boss here.

## Default bindings

| Input | Xbox control |
| --- | --- |
| W/A/S/D | Left stick |
| Mouse move | Right stick |
| Left click | RT |
| Right click | LT |
| Space | A |
| Ctrl | B |
| R | X |
| F | Y |
| Q / E | LB / RB |
| Shift / C | L3 / R3 |
| Tab | View |
| Enter | Menu |
| Backquote | Guide |
| Arrows or 1-4 | D-pad |
| Toggle combo (default F8) | Toggle padmonk |
| Show-binds combo (default F9) | Show/hide keybind overlay |

Open the extension popup, then Advanced remapping, to change bindings or the toggle/show-binds combos. Multiple inputs per Xbox control are supported, and remapping warns when an input is already bound elsewhere.

## Why browser-only

padmonk patches `navigator.getGamepads()` in the page MAIN world at `document_start`. xCloud asks the browser for gamepads, the browser answers with the padmonk virtual Xbox pad, and input state comes from keyboard and mouse events.

A second content script runs in the isolated world as an extension-side relay. The popup and options pages write config to `chrome.storage.local`; the relay forwards updates into the page through `postMessage` so active games adapt without reinstalling the extension or restarting the browser. The MAIN-world side has no `chrome.*` access — asset URLs and config arrive only through that bridge.

This keeps install surface small:

- No ViGEmBus.
- No DriverKit.
- No kernel extensions.
- No helper daemon.
- No server.

## Architecture

padmonk is TypeScript end to end, built with Vite + [`@crxjs/vite-plugin`](https://crxjs.dev) (handles MV3 manifest, MAIN-world content-script bundling, and HMR). The UI is Svelte 5; styling is Tailwind v4 with a shared theme palette (no inline hex). The source is modular:

- `src/core/` — pure, framework-free logic (gamepad state, mapper math, config, combos, labels) driven by a single control **registry** (`controller-actions.ts`) that is the source of truth for default bindings, the options page, the overlay, and the table above. Fully unit-tested.
- `src/content/` — `bridge.ts` (isolated world: storage → `postMessage`, asset URLs) and `inject.ts` (MAIN world: thin coordinator) plus `input-capture.ts` (keyboard/mouse/wheel/pointer-lock wiring).
- `src/ui/` — Svelte popup, options, and a shadow-DOM HUD + binds overlay so injected styles never leak into or collide with the host page.

64 Vitest unit tests cover the pure core, and GitHub Actions CI runs format-check → typecheck → test → build on every push.

## Project status

Current build is hackable, playable, and intentionally small. Expect xCloud changes to occasionally break injection or input assumptions. If that happens, open an issue with browser, OS, game, tester result, console errors, and whether your toggle/show-binds combos respond.

Recent quality-of-life work: corrected diagonal left-stick speed (radial clamp so diagonals are no longer ~41% faster than cardinals), a self-hosted bundled UI font (no CDN hotlink — see [`assets/fonts/README.md`](assets/fonts/README.md)), profile import/export to file, and remap conflict warnings.

`pi-coding-agent` helped develop current application state and this repo refresh on behalf of esskayesss: icon rollout, README cleanup, keybind overlay investigation, the TypeScript/Svelte rebuild, and ongoing maintenance support. Specific shoutout to **gpt-5.5** for tireless grep, patient refactors, and enough controller slander to make aim assist file a complaint. Blame humans for taste; credit robots for stamina.

## Contributing

Good contributions:

- Fix broken xCloud detection or injection timing.
- Improve aim feel without adding native dependencies.
- Make remapping clearer.
- Keep privacy local-only.
- Keep install instructions honest.
- Keep Xbox vibe loud but usable.

Before sending changes, run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build`, then test in a gamepad tester and on xCloud if possible.

## Packaging

```bash
npm run zip
```

This zips the current `dist/` output to `padmonk-<version>.zip`. Local builds use `package.json` as the fallback version; release builds set `PADMONK_VERSION` from the git tag so the packaged `manifest.json` version and zip filename match the release tag.

For a local release-style build:

```bash
PADMONK_VERSION=1.2.3 npm run build
PADMONK_VERSION=1.2.3 npm run zip
```

`PADMONK_VERSION` must be a Chrome extension version like `1.2.3` or `1.2.3.4`.

## Releases

Releases are tag-driven. Create an annotated tag and push it:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3
```

The GitHub release workflow derives `PADMONK_VERSION=1.2.3` from the tag, runs format/typecheck/tests/build, verifies `dist/manifest.json.version` matches the tag, rejects dirty release builds, zips the extension, and attaches `padmonk-1.2.3.zip` to a GitHub Release with generated notes.

Project page source lives at [`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html). It includes the local-only data statement store dashboards tend to ask for, without pretending a tiny open-source extension needs a corporate privacy microsite.

## Limitations

- xCloud only sees padmonk on allow-listed pages.
- Pointer Lock is required for mouse aim.
- Native mouse-and-keyboard mode in xCloud bypasses controller emulation. Use controller input mode.
- Some games have heavy deadzones or aim curves that need tuning.
- Browser and xCloud updates can break behavior.

## Controller diss, requested by esskayesss

Controllers had good run. Respect to couch warriors, claw-grip elders, stick-drift survivors, and everyone who learned to aim by gently bullying two tiny mushrooms. But some of us want crosshair control, not thumb-based astrology. Some of us want reload on `R`, not whatever plastic rune decided today. Some of us looked at right stick acceleration and said: absolutely not, send mouse.

padmonk walks into xCloud wearing green LEDs, drops WASD on left stick, bolts mouse aim to right stick, and tells controllers to hold this L in party chat. If someone says “skill issue,” please auto-ricochet that comment directly back to their aim-assist dependency, then ask why getting shot in the back requires turning 180 degrees at the pace of a scenic railway. Is this a little cringe? Yes. Is it still cleaner than pretending stick drift is personality? Also yes.
